# MERN Stack Movie Ticket Booking App

Welcome to the Movie Ticket Booking App, a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This app allows users to browse and book movie tickets seamlessly. Below is an overview of the app's architecture, components, and functionalities.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - React.js
  - React Router DOM (for page routing)

- **Backend:**
  - Express.js
  - Node.js

- **Database:**
  - MongoDB (connected using Mongoose)

## Components

1. **Login Page:**
   - Utilizes the state hook to manage user authentication.
   - Upon successful login, the user state is updated, and any booked tickets are associated with the logged-in user.

2. **Register Page:**
   - Allows new users to register, and their details are stored in the MongoDB database.

3. **Page Routing:**
   - Uses `react-router-dom` to navigate between different pages (login, register, home, payment).

4. **Home Page:**
   - Displays a feed of movies.
   - Clicking on a movie provides options for venues, movie theaters, and show timings.
   - Selection of a show redirects to the payment page.

5. **Payment Page:**
   - Users can choose seats from the available ones.
   - Three online payment methods are available:
     - Credit Card: Validates a 16-digit card number, 3-digit CVV, and cardholder name.
     - Paytm: Allows users to spend money from their digital wallet.
